Start when a sample for the sensorâ€™s model is saved in database

n_pre_train = 0
pre_train_samples = []
load model from database

While n_pre_train < pre_train_size:
	sample = sample loaded from database
	insert sample in pre_train_samples
	n_pre_train = n_pre_train + 1

Pre train the model with the pre_train_samples

Update the model in database

n_samples_evaluated = 0

While there is new samples in database or the request to stop not received:

	sample = next sample loaded from database

	evaluate model in prequential way with the sample
	
	if n_samples_evaluated > n_samples_to_save then:
		update the model in database
		n_samples_evaluated = 0
	
	n_samples_evaluated = n_samples_evaluated + 1
	
	save predicted value in database

Update model in database
