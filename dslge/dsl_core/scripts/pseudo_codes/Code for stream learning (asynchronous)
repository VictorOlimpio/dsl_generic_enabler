Start when a sample for the sensorâ€™s model is saved in database

n_pre_train = 0
pre_train_samples = []
model = model loeaded from database

if the model is not pre trained:

	While n_pre_train < pre_train_size:
		sample = sample loaded from database
		insert sample in pre_train_samples
		n_pre_train = n_pre_train + 1

	model.pre_train(pre_train_samples) //Pre train the model with the pre_train_samples
	model.pre_trained = true
	Update the model in database
else:

	n_samples_evaluated = 0

	While there is new samples in database:

		sample = sample loaded from database
		evaluate model in prequential way with the sample
		n_samples_evaluated = n_samples_evaluated + 1

		if n_samples_evaluated == n_samples_to_save then:
			update the model in database
			n_samples_evaluated = 0
		
		save predicted value in database

Update model in database
